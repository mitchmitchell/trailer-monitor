sentence=A library to support the checking when an electron is powered by a battery.
paragraph=This is an update to the original AssetTracker driver. That driver supported a different GPS receiver than is used on the Asset Tracker 2. This version uses the UbloxM8Q_GPS driver to support the Asset Tracker 2 GPS receiver. This version adds support for the odometer and Static Hold (see ublox specs). This version only adds a repository.
